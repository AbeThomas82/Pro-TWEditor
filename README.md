# Pro-TWEditor

## Description
In this challenge, we were required to assume the role of a developer for a Progressive Web Application. The site will be called JATE for "just another text editor" and will allow the user to input and save their desired text to an indexed database (IndexedDB). An added bonus to this application is that the user will also be able to use the application offline.

Included in the application is starter code. From that, we would have to add and install necessary components in order to have the PWA perform as desired.

## Installation
Modified JS scripts for the exercise.

Required the installation of express.js, nodemon, concurrently, if-env, idb, and a bevy of other components to implement seeding and organization of the information contained within the code.

Used PORT 3000 to implement running the application upon execution of npm start command.

Completed code pushed to GitHub.

Application and deployment implemented via Heroku.  Links are provided further down in this README.

## Usage
The end user will be able to run the application from the CLI in Visual Studio Code. Once the command "npm start" is entered, the port 3000 will be run, thus making the assignment ready to be tested on Insomnia. From there, the user can manipulate the database as needed. In the web browser, input the [URL](http://localhost:3000)

The application works as follows:

- Users are able to add the text of their choosing by inputting it into the JATE progressive web application. 

- Once complete, click on the "Install!" button located in the blue header section of the application.

- With the now saved text, in the URL box, click on the icon with the square and arrow (facing diagonally upwards and to the right) to open the text editor in the application of your choice.

- PWA Editor should be selected and the PWA will open separately from the browser.

- The text entered during the browser stage should be present in the PWA Editor as well.

- Under the Application section of Inspect (found when right-clicking the page), the developer/user should be able to access:

1. Manifest.json
2. Service Workers
3. IndexedDB storage values

With this application, I hope that the user found the PWA editing experience as fruitful and as enjoying as it was for me in developing it. Thank you.
